# Frontend Assignment

This repo contains two reusable React components built with **React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Storybook**.

## Components
- **InputField** → Flexible input with validation states, variants, sizes, helper/error text, and password toggle.
- **DataTable** → Sortable, selectable data table with loading & empty states.

## Setup Instructions
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd frontend-assignment
npm install
npm run dev         # start app
npm run storybook   # start storybook
```

## Approach
- Components are modular and typed with TypeScript for scalability.
- TailwindCSS ensures responsive UI quickly.
- Storybook used for isolated component documentation.
- Demo available in `App.tsx`.
